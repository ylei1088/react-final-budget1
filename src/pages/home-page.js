  //       <p>
  //         Since budgeting allows you to create a spending plan for your money,
  //         it ensures that you will always have enough money for the things you
  //         need and the things that are important to you. Budget Planning wants
  //         to set you up for success by helping you create a realistic budget
  //         that accounts for all of your expenses. We advocate the 50/30/20
  //         budget as the best way to spend your money responsibly.
  //       </p>
  //       <h4>
  //         Let start with our calculator to estimate how you should divide your
  //         monthly income into needs, wants and savings.
